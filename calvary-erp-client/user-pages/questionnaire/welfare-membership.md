# Welfare Membership Questionnaire — How To Guide

1. Navigate to **Welfare Membership** from the top navigation bar or visit `/questionnaires/welfare-membership` directly.
2. Read the introduction to confirm you are on the correct form.
3. Complete the **Member details** section. Required fields are marked with an asterisk and display guidance messages if left blank or formatted incorrectly.
4. Use the **Add another** button in the **Children** section to record each dependent. Each child card can be removed with the **Remove** button when more than the minimum entry exists.
5. Review your answers, then select **Submit**. While the request is being processed the button shows “Submitting…”.
6. When the submission succeeds a green confirmation message appears. If an error occurs a red message prompts you to retry later.
